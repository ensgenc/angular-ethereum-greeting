## Metamask
Metamask helps you handle account management and connecting the current user to the blockchain. MetaMask enables users to manage their accounts and keys in a few different ways while isolating them from the site context.

Once a user has connected their MetaMask wallet, you as a developer can interact with the globally available Ethereum API (window.ethereum) that identifies the users of web3-compatible browsers (like MetaMask users). Whenever you request a transaction signature, MetaMask will prompt the user in a comprehensible way.
